# Project description

## Project goal
This project aims to support restaurants providing food services to private and company clients.

## General info
The restaurant can offer both food (e.g. lunch, appetizers) and non-alcoholic beverages (for instance coffee, water).
The service is provided on the restaurant premises, but a takeaway option is also available. If chosen, it can be
ordered in the restaurant or in advance using an online form in which the customer should select a preferred date for
their food to be picked up.
The restaurant has at its disposal only so many tables and seats, so it allows customers to book a table for at least
two people beforehand.

The customers are both private and company clients (the latter collect bigger orders on lunch breaks or as a catering,
although without delivery). The restaurant can issue invoices for companies, either for a specific order or for the
whole month.

## Menu
The menu is established at least one day ahead of it coming into force. Additionally, no less than half of the menu's
positions must be changed, at the minimum, once every two weeks.

From Thursday to Saturday customers can, beforehand, order dishes which include seafood. Given the difficulty of
supplying the restaurant with such goods, the order must be placed by the preceding Monday at the latest.

## Placing an order or booking a table in advance
The online form allows private clients to book a table and, concurrently, place an order if following conditions are
met: the order amount is minimum *WZ* (e.g. *WZ* = $50) and the customer placed at least *WK* orders in the past (e.g.
*WK* = 5). The payment can be made before or after the order. When the reservation is accepted by the service, the
client receives a confirmation.

## Discounts
The database allows the following discount program for private clients:
- after completing a given number of orders *Z1* (e.g. *Z1* = 10) for at least *K1* (e.g. *K1* = $30 for every order): 
*R1*% (e.g *R1* = 3%) discount for every order);
- after completing a given number of orders for *K2* (e.g. *K2* = $1000): a one-time discount *R2%* (e.g. *R2* = 5%) for
orders placed for *D1* days (e.g. *D1* = 7) starting from the day of receiving the discount (discount don't stack).
